TODO

* Make it more portable (currently has library paths hardcoded)
** Plunder Device::USB for setting env variables/using them in module.
* Allow node values to be arbitrary perl types (currently just strings)
** First stab at this, seems to work but need to check out the mem management.
*** See below. 
* Write POD documentation for module API
** Stubs are in now.
* Figure out what's necessary to place it on CPAN
** Need to finalise the name. 
*** investigate <module-authors@perl.org>?
* Figure out why keys > size for duplicate keys. Can you still access the dupe?
* Also, (possibly related), bug: 
  "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0xc35550 during global destruction."
** appears to be when removing a node whose value is a reference.
   solution might be to provide a custom destructor function?
*** typedef void (*cp_destructor_fn)(void *);
