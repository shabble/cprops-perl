TODO

* Make it more portable (currently has library paths hardcoded)
** Plunder Device::USB for setting env variables/using them in module.
* Figure out what's necessary to place it on CPAN
** Need to finalise the name. 
*** investigate <module-authors@perl.org>?
* Figure out why keys > size for duplicate keys. Can you still access the dupe?
