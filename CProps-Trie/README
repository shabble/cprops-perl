CProps-Trie version 0.1
=======================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

--- old ---

A Perl interface for some of the data-structures provided by the cprops library
(http://cprops.sourceforge.net/)

Currently only implements the Trie structure, but future plans may include
AVL and RB trees if there is any demand.

Perl has good vector (array) and hashtable (hash) support already, so there's
no real point supporting those.


TODO:
-----

* Make it more portable (currently has library paths hardcoded)
* Allow node values to be arbitrary perl types (currently just strings)
** First stab at this, seems to work but need to check out the mem management. 
* Write POD documentation for module API
* Figure out what's necessary to place it on CPAN
