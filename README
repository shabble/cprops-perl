A Perl interface for some of the data-structures provided by the cprops library
(http://cprops.sourceforge.net/)

Currently only implements the Trie structure, but future plans may include
AVL and RB trees if there is any demand.

Perl has good vector (array) and hashtable (hash) support already, so there's
no real point supporting those.


TODO:
-----

* Make it more portable (currently has library paths hardcoded)
* Allow node values to be arbitrary perl types (currently just strings)
** First stab at this, seems to work but need to check out the mem management. 
* Write POD documentation for module API
* Figure out what's necessary to place it on CPAN
