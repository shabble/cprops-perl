A Perl interface for some of the data-structures provided by the cprops library
(http://cprops.sourceforge.net/)

Currently only implements the Trie structure, but future plans may include
AVL and RB trees if there is any demand.

Perl has good vector (array) and hashtable (hash) support already, so there's
no real point supporting those.


TODO:
-----

* Make it more portable (currently has library paths hardcoded)
* Write POD documentation for module API
* Figure out what's necessary to place it on CPAN
